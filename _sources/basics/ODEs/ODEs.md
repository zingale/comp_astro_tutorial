Ordinary Differential Equations
===============================

There are a lot of methods for solving ordinary differential equations
numerically.  We'll look at a few common ones&mdash;essentially what
we will need for integrating the equations of hydrodynamics later.

We are going to be skipping entire classes of methods, including
implicit methods (useful for stiff equations like those arising in
reaction networks), multistep methods, and sympletic integrators
(useful for N-body methods where energy conservation is desired).
