Multigrid
=========

Now we learn how to transfer data between grids at different
resolution and use it to accelerate the convergence of our relaxation.

A lot of inspiration came from the fantastic book *A Multigrid
Tutorial* by W. L. Briggs.  That text mostly works with node-centered
grids, while we work with cell-centered / finite-volume grids.
